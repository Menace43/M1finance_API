# M1finance_API
Trying to build an API that would download user data from M1 Finance

# Why
I am trying to build a portfolio tracker but the way it works right now is that you have to automatically download csv files for the tracker to work perfectly. I then tried to automate it but the clearing house for M1 finance was "APEX CLEARING" which was good for a while because there are a plethora of resources for that API. Unfortunately, M1 finance just changed their clearing house to one in house [meaning their own personal clearing house] so to help me access the user data automatically, I am saddled with the task of build an API from scratch.
 PS I am using this project for learning and also because I couldn't find M1 finance API. If anypone wants to help I would be greatful
